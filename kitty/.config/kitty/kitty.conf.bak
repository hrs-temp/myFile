# Kitty Configuration for Harsh's GitHub Dark Theme Setup
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# ** 1. FONT SETTINGS **

# The primary font family for regular, bold, and italic text.
# IMPORTANT: Kitty needs the full font name (often the PostScript name).
# If the name below doesn't work, you'll need to run:
# kitty + list-fonts --psnames | grep Comic
font_family      ComicShannsMonoNerdFontMono-Regular

# Fallback fonts for symbols/icons if the main font doesn't have them
# Nerd Font Mono usually covers all icons, but it's good practice.
# This option typically points to the font file itself if it's not
# installed globally, but usually, kitty finds it if it's in ~/.fonts/
# You have the file at: /home/hrs/.fonts/ComicShannsMonoNerdFontMono-Regular.otf
# However, you should install it to your system's font folder for best results.
# If you insist on the file path, the syntax is more complex (using the PostScript name).
# For now, let's use the assumed PostScript name:

# Set the font size in points (pts)
font_size        14.0

# You can set this if the font looks too heavy or light:
# bold_font        auto
# italic_font      auto
# bold_italic_font auto

# ** 2. COLOR SETTINGS **

# Match the GitHub Dark Default theme background color: #0d1117
background       #0d1117

# Match the Neovim foreground (text) color (assuming a light grey/white for contrast)
# For the github_dark theme, a good foreground is often #e6edf3 or plain white:
foreground       #ffffff

# Optional: Add some window padding to prevent content from touching the edges
# window_padding_width 10
